# About my Simon Game Project on Github
 •
 The Simon Game is a classic memory-based electronic game 
where players need to remember and repeat a series of tones 
and lights.
 •
 Each time the player successfully matches the sequence, the 
game adds another step to the sequence. The goal is to see 
how many steps can be correctly repeated in a row. 
•
 The game's progressive difficulty makes it a great tool for 
memory training, as it continuously pushes players to 
remember and recall longer sequences, improving their 
memory and concentration over time.
